# Task-6-Elevate_Labs
# Create a Strong Password and Evaluate Its Strength

## Objective
The goal of this task is to understand what makes a password strong, explore various password structures, evaluate them using online strength checkers, and research common password attacks and password security best practices.

## Passwords Created and Tested

| Password                  | Score (%) | Tool Feedback                                   |
|---------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------|
| hello123                  | 25%       | Too short; lacks symbols and uppercase letters   |
| Hello123                  | 40%       | Still weak; missing symbols                      |
| Hello123!                 | 60%       | Better; but could be longer                      |
| H3ll0_World!              | 80%       | Strong; good complexity and special characters   |
| G7^dL!9&zB@2              | 100%      | Excellent; random and complex                    |
| ThisIsMy$ecureP@ssw0rd    | 90%       | Very strong; passphrase-style with symbols       |
| T1m#2b*9UeP@Yq            | 100%      | Secure and highly unpredictable                  |

## Analysis

### Observations
- Length significantly increases password strength.
- Including uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special symbols results in stronger passwords.
- Predictable patterns (like names or keyboard sequences) weaken password strength.
- Passphrases (e.g., `Cats!Fly$At9AM`) are both memorable and strong.

## Research: Common Password Attacks

### Brute Force Attack
An automated process that tries every possible character combination until it finds the correct one. Short passwords are cracked very quickly.

### Dictionary Attack
Uses a precompiled list of common passwords or dictionary words. Passwords like `password123` or `letmein` are easily cracked this way.

### Credential Stuffing
Attackers use leaked username/password pairs to gain unauthorized access across websites.

### Phishing
Tricks users into revealing their passwords by pretending to be a trustworthy source.

## Best Practices for Strong Passwords

- Use at least 12â€“16 characters.
- Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.
- Avoid using personal information (birthdays, names).
- Don't reuse passwords across different websites.
- Use passphrases for better memorability and strength.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) whenever possible.
- Use a password manager to generate and store complex passwords securely.

## Key Takeaways

- Password complexity offers greater protection against brute-force and dictionary attacks.
- Length is crucial: longer passwords take exponentially more time to crack.
- Tools like password checkers help analyze weaknesses and suggest improvements.
- MFA adds an essential layer of protection beyond the password alone.

## Outcome
Through this activity, I gained practical insight into creating secure passwords, learned how attackers attempt to crack them, and now understand industry best practices to protect accounts effectively.
